We ordered chicken items and nan along with chicken biryani. Though they did not serve either gravy or raita with biryani but accepted the mistake when we raised the concern. However as we did not need either of those so we called it out after finishing the food. The restaurant is bit on higher side of price compared to the portion of food and the taste combined. The biryani was of ~600 which is just sufficient for one person. Excellent interiors and lighting.

They have parking space for 4-5 cars. The restaurant was half occupied. We got the seats by usher in no time. The food was good and had taste. Staff was courteous and caring. We ordered chicken items and nan along with chicken biryani. Though they did not serve either gravy or raita with biryani but accepted the mistake when we raised the concern. However as we did not need either of those so we called it out after finishing the food. The restaurant is bit on higher side of price compared to the portion of food and the taste combined. The biryani was of ~600 which is just sufficient for one person. Excellent interiors and lighting. They serve finger bowl with rose water which i really liked.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATEDn  I always have preferred the Ala-carte menu over their buffet spread.nComing to the food, felt didn\\'t have much variety of food to offer, but we were satisfied with whatever had ordered.nnWe ordered mini chole bhature trio, peshawari mutton kebab and chicken biriyaninTheir food presentation definitely improved for good in compare to the last time when I visited this place.nGood job guys, and special call out to the Zomato Gold!
