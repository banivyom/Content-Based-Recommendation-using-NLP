We ordered chicken items and nan along with chicken biryani. Though they did not serve either gravy or raita with biryani but accepted the mistake when we raised the concern. However as we did not need either of those so we called it out after finishing the food. The restaurant is bit on higher side of price compared to the portion of food and the taste combined.

Gulab jamun cheesecake was the biggest let down - all looks and no taste. Would commend that they got us aloo parathas on request, even though they weren\\'t on the menu.

The ambience is beautiful; we were seated next to an artificial waterfall, and the soothing sound of water only added to our appetite.nnThe food was good, not great. The chicken shorba was bland and the worst among all. The starts were moderately good, both veg and non veg. We tried few things in the main course, and it met the expectations. Desserts were standard, and the service was quick and friendly.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATEDn  **Short visit**nnIt happened to visit this place with my friend during lunch time, its situated on dairy circle road.

Heard a lot about this place when I used to live in Delhi. So finally got a chance to visit its koramangala branch. It was a saturday evening and booking the table in advance made it comfortable for us. Mr. Prashanth was there for taking care of our dinner party and I must say he made the experience memorable. He was calm,courteous and co-operated while ordering as well. It was our first visit and whatever we ordered (all veg) i.e. shami kabab, dahi kabab, paneer tikka, french fries for starters and pindi chhole, panner tawa masala and kaali dal for main course accompanied by tandoori rotis and nan, everything single thing was just toothsome. For beverages we ordered cold coffee and lemon soda. Cold coffee was more on the sweeter side for us but Mr. Prashanth replaced it with a perfect one. Overall it was a great family dinner!

They have parking space for 4-5 cars. The restaurant was half occupied. We got the seats by usher in no time. The food was good and had taste. Staff was courteous and caring. We ordered chicken items and nan along with chicken biryani. Though they did not serve either gravy or raita with biryani but accepted the mistake when we raised the concern. However as we did not need either of those so we called it out after finishing the food. The restaurant is bit on higher side of price compared to the portion of food and the taste combined. The biryani was of ~600 which is just sufficient for one person. Excellent interiors and lighting. They serve finger bowl with rose water which i really liked.\\'), (\\'Rated 4.0\\', \"RATEDn  I always have preferred the Ala-carte menu over their buffet spread.nComing to the food, felt didn\\'t have much variety of food to offer, but we were satisfied with whatever had ordered.nnWe ordered mini chole bhature trio, peshawari mutton kebab and chicken biriyaninTheir food presentation definitely improved for good in compare to the last time when I visited this place.nGood job guys, and special call out to the Zomato Gold!
